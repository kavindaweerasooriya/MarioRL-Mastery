# MarioRL Mastery

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Super Mario Bros using the PPO algorithm from the Stable Baselines3 library. The environment is provided by the `gym_super_mario_bros` library.

Used reinforcement learning to teach an agent to navigate and play Super Mario Bros autonomously. With the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Stable Baselines3 library, the agent learns strategies for successful gameplay within the gym_super_mario_bros environment. Dependencies include Python 3.6+, gym_super_mario_bros, stable-baselines3, nes_py, torch, torchvision, and torchaudio. Can easily install the required dependencies and initiate training by executing the provided model.py script. The default setting trains the agent for 5000 steps, but users can customize this parameter based on their preferences.

This project was inspired by the article ["Reinforcement learning in Super Mario bros"](https://dev.to/akilesh/reinforcement-learning-in-super-mario-bros-56i9) by Akilesh.
